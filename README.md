# MLPy
Maintenance Language Processing: Quantifying tacit human knowledge with python, for maintnenance-based investigatory analysis

# Purpose
There is often a large amount of maintenance data *already* available for use in Smart Manufacturing systems, but in a currently-unusable form: service tickets and maintenance work orders (MWOs). MLPy is a toolkit for using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with efficient user-interaction to perform structured data extraction with minimal annotation time-cost. 


# Getting Started

## What's Inside?
NOTE: this repository is under construction, and tutorial .ipynb documents are still being written. Documentation is currently code-internal only, however, dedicated documentation hosted through sphynx/readthedocs.io is underway. 

Current: 
- Tagging Tool: Human-in-the-loop Annotation Interface (pyqt)
- Unstructured data processing toolkit (sklearn-style)
- Vizualization tools for tagged MWOs-style data (under development)

Planned/underway: 
- KPI creation and visualization suite
- Machine-assisted functional taxonomy generation 
- Quantitative skill assement and training suggestion engine
- Graph Database creation assistance and query tool


## Pre-requisites
This package was built as compatible with Anaconda python distribution. See our [conda env file](/tree/standalone/nist-tagging-tool.yml) for a complete list of major dependencies.

# Who are we?
This toolkit is a part of the Knowledge Extraction and Application for Smart Manufacturing (KEA) project, within the Systems Integration Division at NIST.

## Why KEA?
Kea are world's only alpine parrots, finding their home on the southern Island of NZ. Known for their intelligence and ability to solve puzzles through the use of tools, they will often work together to reach their goals, which is especially important in their harsh, mountainous habitat. The KEA project seeks to better frame data collection and transformation systems within smart manufacturing as *collaborations* between human experts and the machines they partner with, to more efficiently utilize the digital and human resources available to manufacturers.

  begin installation of magnet
  bring magnet in from crash cart
  bring in the second and third magnet use the same process above
  install magnet protection panel
  continue to remove magnet use the previous step in the procedure
  complete pre task safety plan ptsp before start this job
  stop and take the time to read precaution to be take with linear motor system serious injury can result if this job plan be not follow
  the follow job plan be to be use as a check list and reinforce the safety concern with change -PRON- linear motor and magnet
  each dept have a linear motor crash cart
  move crash cart to job site
  please check off each task as -PRON- have be complete
  once machine have be position and lock out
  bring a wooden magnet box from the crash cart into the machine work area
  any expose secondary motor magnet require a nylon protective cover be place over top of each magnet before work can continue see picture 1
  remove the magnetized protection guard on the secondary motor magnet
  determine which replacement part will be require for this job

  the follow step below be to be post at the machine on a white board
  old spindle need to be mrf tag that be not use so that -PRON- can be return for repair
  as the job be get close to spindle startup
  go to stock room and bring up spindle if require
  be there any special platform to be bring over to the machine
  open drawer on crash cart spindle replacement part tool
  spindle exchange crash cart
  new spindle will be kitt on the crash cart
  assign the trade to begin the spindle removal and have -PRON- all meet at the job site
  bring spindle change crash cart to the machine
  the follow step outline what material will be require for a spindle change on a comau smartdrive machine
  remove gravity pin and low y axis
  disconnect electrical connection
  disconnect cool coolant connection
  raise spindle to upper position on y axis
  install work platform in machine
  preform spindle run in procedure 700xl
  remove spindle mount bolt
  remove spindle from the machine
  place old spindle on spindle crash cart
  install new cable for deublin union
  clean area where spindle will be mount
  install spindle and remove install ring
  tighten mount bolt for spindle
  raise spindle and install gravity pin
  connect electrical connection on back of spindle

  clean up the area
  connect electrical connection on back of spindle
  wash area down with coolant and try to clean area of all loose chip
  each dept have a linear motor crash cart
  remove the magnetized protection guard on the secondary motor magnet
  any expose secondary motor magnet require a nylon protective cover be place over top of each magnet before work can continue see picture 1
  bring a wooden magnet box from the crash cart into the machine work area
  continue to remove magnet use the previous step in the procedure
  slide axis and primary liner motor over area where magnet be remove
  disconnect primary liner motor connection
  the follow job plan be to be use as a check list and reinforce the safety concern with change -PRON- linear motor and magnet
  stop and take the time to read precaution to be take with linear motor system serious injury can result if this job plan be not follow
  once machine have be position and lock out
  complete pre task safety plan ptsp before start this job
  please check off each task as -PRON- have be complete
  move crash cart to job site
  determine which replacement part will be require for this job
  with all component remove clean the area
  reinstall the primary linear motor
  check all connection
  begin installation of magnet
  bring magnet in from crash cart
  bring in the second and third magnet use the same process above
  install magnet protection panel
  reinstall machine guard
  conduct rotor shim on power up
  referance machine
  part of first part cut
  area cleanup
  dispose of old or damaged magnet
  please make comment on this job plan
  move axis back over secondary motor magnet that be not remove

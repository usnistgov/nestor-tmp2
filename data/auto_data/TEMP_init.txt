DISCONNECT ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS
The following steps outline what material will be required for a spindle change on a Comau Smartdrive machine.
Bring spindle change crash cart to the Machine
Assign the Trades to begin the spindle removal and have them all meet at the job site
New spindle will be kitted on the crash cart.
Spindle Exchange Crash Cart
Open drawer on Crash Cart (Spindle Replacement Parts & Tools)
Are there any special platforms to be brought over to the machine.
Go to stock room and bring up spindle if required
As the job is getting close to spindle startup.
Old spindle needs to be MRF' tagged that were not used so that they can be returned for repair
THE FOLLOWING STEPS BELOW ARE TO BE POSTED AT THE MACHINE ON A WHITE BOARD
DOCUMENT TIME SPINDLE REPLACEMENT START
MACHINE PUT INTO POSITION FOR LOCKOUT
INSTALL WORK PLATFORM IN MACHINE
RAISE SPINDLE TO UPPER POSITION ON Y AXIS
DISCONNECT COOLING/COOLANT CONNECTIONS
REMOVE GRAVITY PIN AND LOWER Y AXIS
MOVE BLOCK FIXTURE OFF TO THE SIDE
REMOVE SPINDLE MOUNTING BOLTS.
PLACE OLD SPINDLE ON SPINDLE CRASH CART
REMOVE SPINDLE FROM THE MACHINE
PART# OF FIRST PART CUT
PREFORM SPINDLE RUN-IN PROCEDURE 700l 700XL
CLEAN UP THE AREA.
RETURN SPINDLE CRASH CART BACK TO SHOP
ETA FIXTURE PROBING 700L ONLY
DEPENDING ON ETA RESULTS
SETTING SPINDLE CLAMP PARAMETERS 700L
INSTALL NEW CABLE FOR DEUBLIN UNION
CLEAN AREA WHERE SPINDLE WILL BE MOUNTED
INSTALL SPINDLE AND REMOVE INSTALL RING
TIGHTEN MOUNTING BOLTS FOR SPINDLE
RAISE SPINDLE AND INSTALL GRAVITY PIN
CONNECT ELECTRICAL CONNECTION ON BACK OF SPINDLE
CONNECT COOLING AND COOLANT LINES
REMOVE GRAVITY PINS AND REMOVE ALL SAFETY LOCKS TO THE MACHINE

"TOO COLD.  231/A103, A250, A245, A267. Yesterday I called and talked with Darrell Smothers concerning the cold temperature on the first floor corridors and side rooms (including A103) of Building 231. The 1st floor area (as well as the 2nd floor side labs including A250) is handled by AHU-1. This morning we noticed that not only is AHU-1 still sending cold air (I measure about 60 °F in A103 and A250) but also AHU-7. AHU-7 services A245 and A267 and should be set for 75 °F and I measure about 68 degrees.  Action taken: On 4-5-2014 a primary main air 3/8"" line for controls was replaced that was damaged causing for very low pressure on main air. This caused for pneumatic controllers to not perform properly. With new line installed we now have proper main air 22# and this has corrected most issues. Another effort is being performed to correct other known issues. John F. and Frank P. are directly involved."

LOW HUMIDITY.  226 / B254 THROUGH B264. Several NIST employees have experienced burning eyes while working in their offices in building 226, from room B254 through B264 this week.

This has been an ongoing issue since July 2013, when Amber Carlberg from the NIST Safety Office set up a humidity monitor in room B256/226, but no action was taken because according to the monitors, the humidity was within the normal range.   We would appreciate having the humidity level for rooms B254, B256, and B264 in building 226 measured and the results reported to Steve McCabe, NEHRP Deputy Director, on extension 8549 as soon as possible. Your immediate attention to this issue would be appreciated. Thank you.  Action Taken:Measured humidity levels. Rooms listed have no humidity controls and can only give what the air handler puts out.

LOW FUME HOOD A/F.. M-Slip Details  Description: Fume hood air flow is too low, tripping alarm routinely when sash is at, and below operational height. The fan or belt drive on this system was replaced or repaired about two months ago, as it was shut down. I highly suspect it is not being run at the same flow it was previously.   Problem Building / Room: 226 / b225 Action taken: Replaced belt on exhaust fan and had support from DDC to help with air balance checks. Found that the issue was with fume hood monitors that were out of calibration. However, this system is fully maxed out. design is allowing for two hoods to be used at same time on a exhaust fan with only a 1/2hp motor and is maxed out for its speed to meet the needs of hoods. This is left from ARRA project and was pointed out at that time for not being acceptable but was left. Life safety is good but the slightest change will cause for low flow alarm.

245 / B033  THE HUMIDITY IS TOO HIGH AT 51.5% IN 245/B033. The humidity in this space needs to be 35%. I need this continual problem fixed. As the Nation's Standard Lab for x-ray dose I need to be able to calibrate even on rainy days. B033 was an environmentally controlled space prior to the new air system and it must be fixed to control temperature and humidity. Please do not make me wait for you to take your measurements. I need someone to adjust the setting IMMEDIATELY so I can continue my work. I am happy to report changes in the humidity by email as I see it change. The other environmentally controlled labs ( B017/B019) and B034 have humidity levels of 46-48% and also need to be MAINTAINED at 35%. These spaces are security controlled areas, limited access areas.

REPLACE AN EXISTING OUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR SERVING THE 301 ADDITION HOT-WATER HEAT EXCHANGER. <div>Contact Carrie Kelly (x6914) for air temperature sensor.  In the DDC panel outside of mechanical room B163-2 (within storeroom), disconnect 24 VAC power (on existing terminal block) to existing combination outside air temperature and humidity sensor.  On Building 301 roof (southeast end), disconnect the input wires and remove the existing temperature/humidity probe that is mounted on the exterior high-bay wall.  Manufacturer instructions indicate that probe can be removed from existing junction box by loosening the black nut within the junction box (this will prevent having to install and seal a new junction box).  Replace with new temperature/humidity probe, reconnect input wires (note: Orange wires on probe connect to temperature input cable and blue/green wires connect to humidity input cable), and 24VAC source wires.  On the Andover frontend workstation in the HVAC shop, enable the outside air temperature input to confirm proper operation of the sensor.  Also, confirm outside humidity reading is correct.</div><div><br /><br /><br />replaced air temperature sensor<br /></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><!-- RICH TEXT -->

When we went outside and looked at the condenser coils one of the three fan motors was not turning. We believe this motor has failed. A different motor failed in March on this same unit and the HVAC shop was able to diagnose the problem and with Hector's help we were able to get it resolved. I would like someone from HVAC to help us diagnose the problem and verify that it is the motor or a fuse or a relay, etc. We can then order the parts and have them delivered next morning to get our server room back in full operation.

For instance, with the blinds closed, the temperature where I sit is 77 degrees at the moment (65 degrees and sunny outside). Has something related to the HVAC system servicing my office changed since the summer? It was previously very responsive (temperature didn't vary greatly if there was sun/no sun, hot/cold day outside, etc.). Can something be adjusted so my office isn't so hot when the sun comes out?   Thanks,  Ben</div><div> </div><div>REBOOTED SOFTWARE AND CHECKED OVER VAV / ALL IS WORKING WELL. </div><!-- RICH TEXT -->

I wanted to ask if someone could examine the hvac system servicing my office. Specific symptom - the hvac has been running continuously since I came in this morning. It normally speeds up, slows down, etc., but it's been running continously. I'm not sure why it would be doing this as it's overcast and &lt; 75 degrees outside. If possible, can I be kept up to date as to what work has been done to check into and resolve this issue via email to livebe01@nist.gov or phone x4411.

The mechanics have looked at it to determine the problem and said everything looks to be in working order but said if it continues to happen, the motor may need to be replaced.

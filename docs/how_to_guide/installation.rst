Installation
------------

This guide helps you to install Nestor onto your computer. There are two modes for installation. They are as follows.


Install from PyPI (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will do a cloud install to your python installation directory.

1. Open a command line terminal


:Linux:      ``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + ``T``
:Windows: 	 ``Windows`` + ``R`` -> Type 'cmd'
:Mac: 		 ``⌘`` + ``Space`` -> Type 'Terminal'

2. Type in ``pip install nist-nestor`` and wait for the install to complete. This installs the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Nestor Tagging Tool.

3. (Optional Step) Type in ``pip install nist-nestor[dash]`` to also install the Nestor Dashboard.

Install using local archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is necessary **only** if you did not install using the above method (using PyPI).

This will be a local install downloaded from a `recent source code release on GitHub <https://github.com/usnistgov/nestor/releases>`__

1. Download the `.zip file <https://github.com/usnistgov/nestor/releases>`__ of the entire **nestor** installation from the Github repository 

2. Extract the files to a directory, preferably with write access.

3. Open a terminal window 

:Linux:      ``Ctrl`` + ``Alt`` + ``T``
:Windows: 	 ``Windows`` + ``R`` -> Type 'cmd'
:Mac: 		 ``⌘`` + ``Space`` -> Type 'Terminal'

4. Navigate to the folder where the files have been extracted to (the folder will have the file setup.py in it).

5. Install **nestor** using the command ``pip install .``

6. (Optional Step) Type in ``pip install .[dash]`` to install the Nestor Dashboard.


How to automatically build documentation (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This section is useful for developers of Nestor.

A version of the documentation for Nestor is hosted at `Readthedocs <http://nestor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
However you may build a local version if required. 

1. If Nestor is not installed and you want to build a local version of the documentation, you can run ``pip install .[docs]``. If Nestor is already installed, navigate to the installation directory and install the `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ dependancies by typing in ``pip install -r requirements/doc.txt``

2. To build HTML documentation navigate into the ``docs`` subdirectory of Nestor and run ``make html``. The HTML source code will be created in ``nestor/_build/html`` and can be opened with the index.html file in a browser.

3. To build PDF documentation `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`__ must be installed. As above, run ``make latex`` and navigate into the ``nestor/_build/latex`` directory. Run ``pdflatex nestor.tex``.

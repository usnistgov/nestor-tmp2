Introduction
============

This application was designed to help manufacturers “tag” their data
according to the methods described in
:raw-latex:`\cite{sexton2017hybrid, sharptoward}`. The goal of this
application is to give understanding to data sets that previously were
too unstructured or filled with jargon to analyze. The current build is
in very early alpha, so please be patient in using this application. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Thurston
Sexton (``thurston.sexton@nist.gov``) or Michael Brundage
(``michael.brundage@nist.gov``). Future changes will be made through our
public Github page, which will be available in the near future.
